# JavaScript Arithmetic and Comparison Operations

## Overview
This JavaScript program demonstrates basic arithmetic, string concatenation, assignment operations, and comparison operations using `console.log` to display results in the console.

## Features
### 1. Arithmetic Operations
The script performs and logs the results of basic arithmetic operations:
- Addition (`+`)
- Subtraction (`-`)
- Multiplication (`*`)
- Division (`/`)
- Exponentiation (`**`)
- Modulus (`%`)

### 2. String Concatenation
The script demonstrates how JavaScript handles string concatenation when combining numbers and strings.

### 3. Assignment Operators
The script showcases:
- Incremental operations (`+=`, `-=`, `*=`, `/=`, `%=`, `**=`)

### 4. Comparison Operators
The script compares values using:
- Loose equality (`==`) vs. strict equality (`===`)
- Inequality (`!=`, `!==`)
- Relational comparisons (`>`, `<`, `>=`, `<=`)

## Usage
1. Open your web browser.
2. Go to the inspect section by right clicking on a blank area and clicking inspect. 
3. Open the browser's developer console and execute the script.

## Example Output
```
5 + 3 =  8
7 - 3 =  4
8 * 2 =  16
27 / 3 =  9
4 to the power of 3 =  64
19 mod 4 =  3
...
5=='5'  true
5==='5'  false
5===5  true
...
```

## Notes
- Using `==` checks for value equality but does not consider type.
- Using `===` checks for both value and type equality.
- String concatenation follows left-to-right evaluation.
